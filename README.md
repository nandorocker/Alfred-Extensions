Some simple extensions to automate my personal processes and learn some script hacking while at it.

Chrome Arguments
---
_Launch Chrome with specifications_

Being a Safari user, there are many situations in which I still need to launch Chrome, like running Flash (I never install it on Safari), or using their Incognito Mode, which I prefer to Safari's.

### Run Chrome on Incognito Mode

	chrome -i
	
### Specify initial URL

	chrome -u [url]
	
Commands can be combined, like so:

	chrome -iu [url]
